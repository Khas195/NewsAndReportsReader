NATIONALISATION
Title:RAYNE’S HOSTILE TAKEOVER
Variable: NewsVar.Turn07_E_BothFullNationalisation
Newspaper: The Economists        
Condition Check: HOS and Bergia Steel full nationalisation


President Rayne’s neverending war on the free economy continues as he announced his most ridiculous plan to the date: Complete nationalisation of Heart of Sordland and Bergia Steel.


Instead of trying to actually solve the recession, he has blamed everything on the two largest private companies of Sordland in a blatant escapism. In the short term, the assets of these companies will be completely moved to the state control. In the long term, this decision sets back our country for at least 20 years! With these companies now belonging to the state, the competitive nature of the free market will slowly disappear in Sordland and it will cause a stagnation.


Nationalisation has never been the solution when it comes to recession and President Rayne has just doomed his own chances of ending the recession in his term.

Today, the government has announced changes to the ownership of the two of the largest private corporations in Sordland. Under President Rayne’s new nationalisation plan, the entirety of Heart of Sordland and Bergia Steel, including all subsidiaries and foreign operations will now belong solely to the state. This move is expected to reduce the extraordinary amount of control the oligarchs have over the Sordish economy. The ex-CEOs of Heart of Sordland and Bergia Steel, Marcel Koronti and Walter Tusk have been silent on the matter and refrained from making any comments thus far.

Sordland is facing a possible constitutional crisis after the USP proposed to the parliament to impeach the chief justice, Orso Hawker, for corrupt conduct and not being “in good behaviour” in accordance with the Sordish constitution.


The move has caused an outcry among many lawmakers, judges and lawyers; most of whom criticized President Rayne and the USP for disregarding judicial independence.


The Grand National Assembly of Sordland will vote on Friday whether to impeach the chief justice or not. This clash between the executive, legislative and judiciary is underlining the power of the USP and President Rayne, who are now going against the most experienced justice of Sordland.

As disappointing as Anton Rayne’s presidency has been, we never thought he would stoop this low.

This can only be seen as a deliberate slight against the Bludish people, and kills any hope of Sordland becoming a more diverse and welcoming nation under Rayne’s governance. We urge you to fight this new law -- whether by writing to your local lawmakers, joining protests or simply showing your defiance by speaking non-Sordish languages in public.

Presented as a measure to promote “integration” and “unity”, the bill was a slap in the face to Sordland’s Bludish population and other non-Sordish speakers, not to mention an outright denial of the diversity that makes this country what it is. Kibener must not be happy about this, but we are.

Condition Check: 
The Unified Language Act has been signed into law by President Rayne after the approval of the Grand National Assembly by majority vote on Thursday following a three-hour debate.


Kesaro Kibener - who campaigned heavily for the bill - also sought to express his gratitude for the confirmation of the new laws, saying it contained much vital new rules that will unify and protect the integrity of the Sordish language and identity.


The new law enforces that the educational institutions of Sordland will teach all classes, except for foreign language lessons, in Sordish, unless they are given specific approval by the Ministry of Education. It also establishes a list of regulations and penalties against the education centers that do not follow the law correctly.

As jubilant Rayne supporters rallied in the big cities, many of the opponents of the changes either came together in groups to protest or made noises with pots and pans from their windows and balconies.


Sordland’s main opposition party PFJP said they would challenge the changes.


There is still the same question in the minds of many: are we entering an era of post-Sollist authoritarianism? President Rayne’s tendency towards the consolidation of power is not only troubling, but very dangerous.

The new changes to the Sordish Constitution are approved and made official by the Supreme Court on Friday. 


The biggest change is probably the decrease in the electoral threshold, which will be opening the way for smaller and dangerous parties to enter the Grand National Assembly. This change coming after all the violence that surrounded Rayne's first term is troubling. Both the Communist Party and the Workers Party of Bludia promote violent ideas and flirt with the dangerous ideology of Malenyevism.

Subsequently, the justices will no longer enjoy absolute immunity, will be able to be impeached and tried for not being “in good behaviour.”


These new set of laws have raised questions about any future changes that may happen to the current composition of the Supreme Court. Will President Rayne use his new authority to shuffle the once-untouchable members, and if so, would that mean we’ll see a pro-Rayne court after living under a pro-Soll court?

The Supreme Court has voted and ruled against the proposed changes to the constitution despite the Grand National Assembly’s approval, marking another setback for the United Sordland Party for their second attempt in changing the constitution after President Alphonso.


The proposed changes to the constitution were aimed to replace several of the major sections that were seen as “unchangeable,” and which many Sords saw as owing its origins to the great President Tarquin Soll from back in 1929.


“This is nothing but a small setback,” said Vice President Petr Vectern in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to reject the proposal.


Although some observers expressed disappointment that the proposal failed, many of whom that opposed the proposal reacted with jubilation in public spaces across Sordland on Friday night.

On Friday, the Supreme Court voted against President Rayne’s constitutional amendments, bringing an end to the discussions around a new constitution.


The proposed changes aimed to take away the Supreme Court’s right to vote on constitutional changes and grant President Rayne sweeping new powers. These powers would have allowed President Rayne to issue decrees on various political, social and economic issues, which would have priority over statute law and not subject to judicial review.


As disappointed Rayne supporters rallied in the big cities against the decision, many of the opponents of the changes either came together in groups in jubilation, celebrating in public spaces and their homes.


The team here at the Radical also supports the decision of the Supreme Court for denying President Rayne an increase in his already-strong powers.


There is still the same question in the minds of many: will the constitution be ever changed? From the looks of it, a president like Anton Rayne is definitely not the one for the job. President Rayne’s tendency towards the consolidation of power was not only troubling, but very dangerous. Thankfully, he did not become the one to change the constitution of ‘29.

As proof, witness the higher-than-ever gap between test scores in Narbel and Holsord.

Even if he could get Soll on the stand, the Supreme Court -- which as we all know has heavily Sollist leanings, if it isn’t controlled by Soll himself -- would never convict him.

Condition Check: autocrat win or loss
The recent challenge to Anton Rayne’s state of emergency does not seem to have fazed our President. In his much-anticipated Address to the Nation, Rayne brushed off the court case as a momentary setback and vowed that he would continue to defend the country from internal threats while keeping his campaign promises and taking Sordland’s economy to new heights. We look forward to seeing what the second half of his presidency will bring.
