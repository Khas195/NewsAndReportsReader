The Wehzek soldiers report that the road along Gumren and Oldeburg is blocked  with a dozen logs. Furthermore, casualties from the Wehlen army are being reported in great numbers. The causes for this seem to be booby traps and frequent raids from the local bludish population as an act of revenge for Operation Bear Trap.

At 7.00 in the morning, the Rumburg armies marched into the city of Estord. The city was empty since the citizens were already evacuated. 

At 9.00 a.m, while the Rumburg armies were savaging and looting what was left of Estord, general Iosef sounded the signal for an all-out assault. 

At 12.45, our first wave clashed with their southern flank, who were guarding the railway. 

At 15.13, our pincer attack started to take shape as the eastern and western armies began to enclose the enemy. Meanwhile, our planes were bombing the logistical and strategic choke points between Estord and Crimsrad. The intensive fighting happened both in the sky and on the ground throughout the night.

Our general commanding the army on the eastern side immediately signaled the victorious news to our headquarter and in the meantime telegraphed the news internationally and to all propaganda spies in Rumburg. 

With their shattered eastern front their flank was exposed and their supply lines were captured and cutoff. As we slowly gained ground, the Rumburg general capitulated facing the inevitable. 

At 14.00 on the same day, Sordland's flag was raised on top of Estord once again.

At 4.00 the following day of the initial assault, Rumburg troops defended the eastern front of Estord routed. In that crucial moment, Rumburg's commander made a decision that changed the tide of the battle. 

At 9.00, he ordered all divisions from all front to withdraw back to the central area of the city. 

At 11.00, as our troops pushed in the vicinity from all sides, the Rumburg general ordered all his men to do a full assault to the east to break out. We were caught off guard and by the time the other armies got to the eastern front, the fighting turned into a melee in which friendly fire became a concern to our generals.

They managed to break our eastern front and at the same time stopped our pincer. With their rear free of our soldiers, they turned around and commenced a full assault on our remaining armies, routing them the following day.

After 3 hours of constant fighting the momentum of the Rumburg armies started to die down.

General Valken ordered an all-out assault to puncture their defensive line at Crimsrad. With our tanks leading the charge, we managed to puncture through Rumburg defences.

By the time the enemy attempted a defence-in-depth to slow us down, Sordland's flag was already flying high in Crimsrad.

The news of the fall of the city led to the collapse of Rumburg troop morale across the battleline. As we started gaining ground, Rumburg generals ordered a full retreat back to defend Tzarsbourgh to avoid a full collapse of the front. But before their armies returned to the city, our tanks and infantry were already assaulting the garrisons of Tzarsbourgh.

As we couldn't send troops to support the eastern flank, the only option at the time was to retreat all divisions back to Lachaven to avoid a full encirclement by the enemy.
