Condition Check: if no deal w Wehlen & immigration relaxed


Bloodthirsty Wiktor Smolak is at it again with his endless operations against the so-called terrorists as he keeps carpet bombing villages composed of innocent citizens.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest reports, the number of Wehzek Bluds displaced by the operation is at least 100.000. They have become refugees, seeking help from nearby countries. Stuck in between, Rumburg, Lespia and Sordland, most of them are choosing our country. We must help these innocent people in the name of humanity or no one else will.\r\n\r\nPresident Rayne has done well with not even accepting a trade deal with a rogue country like Wehlen. We all know the saying: ‘Even a broken clock is right twice a day’.

Condition Check: HOS and Bergia Steel full nationalisation


President Rayne’s neverending war on the free economy continues as he announced his most ridiculous plan to the date: Complete nationalisation of Heart of Sordland and Bergia Steel.


Instead of trying to actually solve the recession, he has blamed everything on the two largest private companies of Sordland in a blatant escapism. In the short term, the assets of these companies will be completely moved to the state control. In the long term, this decision sets back our country for at least 20 years! With these companies now belonging to the state, the competitive nature of the free market will slowly disappear in Sordland and it will cause a stagnation.


Nationalisation has never been the solution when it comes to recession and President Rayne has just doomed his own chances of ending the recession in his term.

Today, the government has announced changes to the ownership of the two of the largest private corporations in Sordland. Under President Rayne’s new nationalisation plan, the entirety of Heart of Sordland and Bergia Steel, including all subsidiaries and foreign operations will now belong solely to the state. This move is expected to reduce the extraordinary amount of control the oligarchs have over the Sordish economy. The ex-CEOs of Heart of Sordland and Bergia Steel, Marcel Koronti and Walter Tusk have been silent on the matter and refrained from making any comments thus far.

Solving the recession may not be an easy task but this is a definitive step to end it once and for all. In the short term, the assets of these companies will be completely privatised and procured by the highest bidder. In the long term, this will trigger revitalisation of our economy by introducing a healthier competition in the Sordish marketplace.

Variable: NewsVar.
Newspaper: Radical        
Condition Check: 
As disappointing as Anton Rayne’s presidency has been, we never thought he would stoop this low. The President just approved an NFP-proposed law that makes Sordish the only allowed language in all of the country’s educational institutions, with the Ministry of Education in charge of granting specific exceptions. This can only be seen as a deliberate slight against the Bludish people, and kills any hope of Sordland becoming a more diverse and welcoming nation under Rayne’s governance. We urge you to fight this new law -- whether by writing to your local lawmakers, joining protests or simply showing your defiance by speaking non-Sordish languages in public.

Bludish separatism is about to become a thing of the past. President Rayne has wisely approved a new law that will enforce the teaching of the Sordish language in schools and universities, with rare individual exceptions granted by the Ministry of Education. No more will Bludish and Agno-Sordish people be allowed to live in this country without speaking its language. The promotion of Sordish as a common tongue from kindergarten onwards will lead to greater unity, fewer misunderstandings and less separation along ethnic lines. We look forward to the bill’s implementation.

Presented as a measure to promote “integration” and “unity”, the bill was a slap in the face to Sordland’s Bludish population and other non-Sordish speakers, not to mention an outright denial of the diversity that makes this country what it is. Kibener must not be happy about this, but we are.

According to Tory, only 70 lawmakers voted in favor of the amendments, failing to reach the 166 threshold. Only one Member of Assembly abstained from voting in the session attended by 251 members of the 250-seat parliament, including President Rayne and Member of Honor, Tarquin Soll.


‘The proposal didn’t even get votes from the 150 people who signed it in the first place. It did not even reach a simple majority. This is the worst result this proposal could have received. It must be humiliating for President Rayne,’ said Tory after the results.

Condition Check: reforms pass assembly vote
Count us surprised: in spite of heavy opposition and a special appearance from old man Tarquin Soll himself, President Rayne actually managed to get his constitutional reforms past the Assembly. We’ve been advocating for change to Soll’s dusty Constitution for years, although it’s doubtful that the changes Rayne is advocating are the same as those we have in mind. 


Even if Rayne decided to come down on the side of democracy and fairness, getting a proposal like this past Gloria Tory’s gavel must have required a great deal of compromise -- and getting approval for the Supreme Court will require even more.

Condition Check: reforms fail assembly vote
Count us unsurprised: thanks to heavy opposition and a special appearance from old man Tarquin Soll himself, President Rayne couldn’t manage to get his constitutional reforms past the Assembly. 


We’ve been advocating for change to Soll’s dusty Constitution for ages, although it’s doubtful that the changes Rayne was advocating were the same as those we had in mind. Still, the failure is discouraging. With Rayne’s reforms in the wastebasket and his reputation similarly trashed, nobody else is likely to try changing the Constitution for years to come.

Condition Check: lost by 1
The dead have risen! Old man Tarquin Soll crawled out of his crypt and dragged himself to Holsord for a single purpose: to vote against Anton Rayne’s constitutional reforms. And it worked. The reforms lost by a single vote, meaning Soll and his dusty Constitution will continue to shape Sordland for years to come. 


We didn’t have high hopes for Rayne’s changes in the first place, but the failure is nonetheless discouraging. Thanks to Soll, we may never have another chance like this during our lifetimes.

Today marked the biggest win of Anton Rayne’s term as the Assembly approved his proposal for reforming the Sordish Constitution. The surprise presence of Tarquin Soll at the proceedings shifted the required number of votes from 166 to a two-thirds majority -- still, Rayne’s new amendments passed with flying colors. 


Only one hurdle now remains: the Supreme Court. We’re hopeful that they, too, will rule in Rayne’s favor so that the people of Sordland finally receive the change they sorely deserve.

Anton Rayne once again proved himself a sad and ineffectual excuse for a President, failing to secure the majority of Assembly votes he needed to pass his controversial constitutional reforms. Even Colonel Tarquin Soll made a rare appearance in Holsord to show his disapproval, cementing Rayne’s defeat. The silver lining to this entire embarrassing affair is that at least, no future President is likely to attempt to disrupt Soll’s constitution again.

Apparently, the famed Erlory “washroom summit” ended in enmity: in President Rayne’s Address to the Nation, he vowed that Tarquin Soll would face a trial for the crimes he committed during his decades-long rule. It’s a bold move and a well-justified decision from Rayne, but we’re not feeling optimistic. Even if he could get Soll on the stand, the Supreme Court -- which as we all know has heavily Sollist leanings, if it isn’t controlled by Soll himself -- would never convict him. But does Rayne have a Supreme Court shake-up in the works? It’s 1956, folks -- anything can happen…

It seems the real goal of his reforms was not to benefit the Sordish people, but to vindictively strip away the immunity of our country’s greatest leader and force him onto the witness stand. 


Announcing his intent during his filmed Address to the Nation, Rayne referred not to any specific act, but to the “crimes committed during Soll’s decades-long rule”. He’ll have to do a lot better than that if he’s truly planning on convicting the father of Sordland as we know it.

Condition Check: reform win or loss/future in hands
In his Address to the Nation, a confident Anton Rayne announced that with his constitutional reforms passed, the future now lies in our hands. The reform process was long and arduous, taking up much of Rayne’s first two years in office. Undoubtedly, the President is relieved to be able to move on and finish fulfilling his campaign promises.

Title:PRESIDENT’S SPEECH UPSTAGED BY FLY
Variable: NewsVar.
Newspaper: the radical
Condition Check: autocrat win or loss
Does anyone care about the Address to the Nation anymore? From the moment Rayne’s mic switched on, we knew we were in for a load of self-serving hot air -- and we got it, with the President mounting a pathetic defense of his state of emergency and braying about his campaign promises. The one spot of excitement was the fly circling round his head during the latter part of the speech. We eagerly watched to see if it would land on him, but it did not -- it seems even flies know better than to touch this man.

Condition Check: autocrat win or loss
The recent challenge to Anton Rayne’s state of emergency does not seem to have fazed our President. In his much-anticipated Address to the Nation, Rayne brushed off the court case as a momentary setback and vowed that he would continue to defend the country from internal threats while keeping his campaign promises and taking Sordland’s economy to new heights. We look forward to seeing what the second half of his presidency will bring.
