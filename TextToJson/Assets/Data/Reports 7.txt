Protests against this bill below.


Reports are always more neutral so just straight up event description according to the bill reaction.


7 Unified Education Language Act


Henceforth the educational institutes of Sordland will teach all classes except for foreign languages, in the official language of the country, unless they are given specific approval by the Ministry of Education. Universities, technical colleges and other schools that provide classes in any language other than Sordish will receive a suspension of operations until they apply for the approval process. Any institution that doesn't abide will be defunded or shut down entirely.
