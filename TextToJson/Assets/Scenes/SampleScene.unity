      newsDescription: "Bloodthirsty Wiktor Smolak is at it again with his endless
        operations against the so-called terrorists as he keeps carpet bombing villages
        composed of innocent citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the latest reports,
        the number of Wehzek Bluds displaced by the operation is at least 100.000.
        They have become refugees, seeking help from nearby countries. Stuck in between,
        Rumburg, Lespia and Sordland, most of them are choosing our country. We must
        help these innocent people in the name of humanity or no one else will.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident
        Rayne has done well with not even accepting a trade deal with a rogue country
        like Wehlen. We all know the saying: \u2018Even a broken clock is right twice
        a day\u2019."

      newsDescription: "Today, the government has announced changes to the ownership
        of the two of the largest private corporations in Sordland. Under President
        Rayne\u2019s new nationalisation plan, the entirety of Heart of Sordland
        and Bergia Steel, including all subsidiaries and foreign operations will
        now belong solely to the state. This move is expected to reduce the extraordinary
        amount of control the oligarchs have over the Sordish economy. The ex-CEOs
        of Heart of Sordland and Bergia Steel, Marcel Koronti and Walter Tusk have
        been silent on the matter and refrained from making any comments thus far."

      newsDescription: "Today, the government has announced changes to the ownership
        of one of the two largest private corporations in Sordland. Under President
        Rayne\u2019s new nationalisation plan, the entirety of Heart of Sordland,
        including all subsidiaries and foreign operations will now belong solely
        to the state. This move is expected to reduce the extraordinary amount of

        of Sordland, Marcel Koronti, has been silent on the matter and refrained

      newsName: WALTER TUSK ARRESTED
      newsDescription: A concerning show of presidential power or a case of just
        desserts? How about both? Corporate fatcat and Lotherberg Group spokesman
        Walter Tusk has been arrested following a meeting with Anton Rayne, who had
        just announced the nationalization of his company Bergia Steel. That corporations
        need more government oversight is indisputable, but a hostile takeover --
        and potentially unlawful arrest -- is not the answer. We hope someone in
        Holsord will be able to rein Rayne in and prevent further such power grabs.

      newsDescription: "As disappointing as Anton Rayne\u2019s presidency has been,
        we never thought he would stoop this low. The President just approved an
        NFP-proposed law that makes Sordish the only allowed language in all of the
        country\u2019s educational institutions, with the Ministry of Education in
        charge of granting specific exceptions. This can only be seen as a deliberate
        slight against the Bludish people, and kills any hope of Sordland becoming
        a more diverse and welcoming nation under Rayne\u2019s governance. We urge
        you to fight this new law -- whether by writing to your local lawmakers,
        joining protests or simply showing your defiance by speaking non-Sordish
        languages in public.\n\n[e]"

        President Rayne has wisely approved a new law that will enforce the teaching
        of the Sordish language in schools and universities, with rare individual
        exceptions granted by the Ministry of Education. No more will Bludish and
        Agno-Sordish people be allowed to live in this country without speaking its
        language. The promotion of Sordish as a common tongue from kindergarten onwards
        will lead to greater unity, fewer misunderstandings and less separation along
        ethnic lines. We look forward to the bill\u2019s implementation.\n\n[g]"

        Presented as a measure to promote \u201Cintegration\u201D and \u201Cunity\u201D,
        the bill was a slap in the face to Sordland\u2019s Bludish population and

        are still out there, but we cannot keep living in fear,\u201D he told Sordland
        Today. The controversial decree, which gave Rayne\u2019s United Sordland
        Party sweeping powers to silence its opposition, was the subject of heated
        debate in the Grand National Assembly prior to its sudden revocation."

        from Holsord with his family, and former president Tarquin Soll, barely seen
        on the mainland since 1949. It is rumored the two of them spoke in the washroom

      newsDescription: "As we expected, Anton Rayne\u2019s decision to privatize
        the Sordland educational system has had a seriously deleterious effect. Young
        people in rural and low-income areas are being increasingly priced out of
        the education they deserve, while a relatively small handful of wealthy families
        reap the benefits. As proof, witness the higher-than-ever gap between test
        scores in Narbel and Holsord. We had high hopes for Education Minister Ciara
        Walda when Rayne first appointed her, but she seems to only be enabling his
        delusions that corporations will solve all of Sordland\u2019s problems. Clearly,
        they both need to go."

        which are now under strict quarantine. However, Health Minister Paskal Beniwoll
        has called for swift action, including country-wide vaccination, to prevent
        the case numbers from multiplying. We concur that this disease -- which is

      newsDescription: "Several villages in Bergia have been safely placed under
        quarantine after a few polio cases were diagnosed in the region. The outbreak
        is largely confined to Wehlen, and there is little chance of further infections
        occurring in Sordland. Even if there was, the disease\u2019s most notorious
        symptom -- paralysis -- is only seen in a minute percentage of cases, and
        there is no need to alter the Sordish way of life, as Health Minister Paskal
        Beniwoll has suggested with his vaccination program, in order to prevent
        its spread."

        to discuss a possible trade deal with General Secretary Emmerich Hegel. Exactly
        what would be on the table is unclear. Hegel has been known to want Sordland\u2019s
        aid in retaking the island of Heljiland, currently under Angnolian control,
        but Rayne would risk international ire for interfering in this decades-long
        dispute. An alliance between the two countries is also not out of the question. 
        What is clear is that this visit will bring Sordland closer to alignment
        with United Contana."

        what would be on the table is unclear, although insiders speculate Rayne

        unclear what the goal of these trade talks will be, although some insiders

        a successful end to their joint operations agains the Bludish Freedom Front
        in Wehlen, the region still remains fraught. Multiple street skirmishes between
        Bluds and Wehzeks have been broken up by peacekeeping troops, while efforts
        to rebuild the homes and businesses that were destroyed in the conflict have
        stalled out. The one upside is that no further retaliation from the Freedom
        Front has been seen.

        ended in enmity: in President Rayne\u2019s Address to the Nation, he vowed
        that Tarquin Soll would face a trial for the crimes he committed during his
        decades-long rule. It\u2019s a bold move and a well-justified decision from
        Rayne, but we\u2019re not feeling optimistic. Even if he could get Soll on
        the stand, the Supreme Court -- which as we all know has heavily Sollist
        leanings, if it isn\u2019t controlled by Soll himself -- would never convict
        him. But does Rayne have a Supreme Court shake-up in the works? It\u2019s
        1956, folks -- anything can happen\u2026"

        Tarquin Soll. It seems the real goal of his reforms was not to benefit the
        Sordish people, but to vindictively strip away the immunity of our country\u2019s
        greatest leader and force him onto the witness stand. \n\nAnnouncing his
        intent during his filmed Address to the Nation, Rayne referred not to any
        specific act, but to the \u201Ccrimes committed during Soll\u2019s decades-long

        between Agnolia and Valgsland. Because of the fact that Sordland is also
        recognizing the island to belong to Agnolia, Valgslandian navy, probably
        with hopes to scare us, has been leading patrolling missions close to our
        territorial waters. Valgsland\u2019s increased navy activities in the Markian
        Sea are heightening a standoff between the Agnolia and Valgsland, sharpening
